# CPP Project Creator

A lightweight utility to streamline the creation of C++ projects with a predefined structure and `CMakeLists.txt`.

## Overview

This tool allows users to quickly set up a new C++ project directory, complete with a `main.cpp` file and a `CMakeLists.txt` file ready for building. This is especially handy for those who frequently create new C++ projects and would like a consistent starting point.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Project Creator**:
   - Navigate to the project directory and create a build directory.
   - Run `cmake ..` followed by `cmake --build .` to compile the project.

2. **Run the Project Creator**:
   - Execute the compiled binary.
   - Provide the desired project name when prompted.

3. **Build Your New Project**:
   - Navigate to your newly created project directory.
   - Create a build directory and navigate into it.
   - Run `cmake ..` followed by `cmake --build .` to compile your new project.
